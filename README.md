# Stack Overflow Developer Survey Analysis

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Summarize key findings and trends from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset.
- Recognize the dataset as a valuable resource for analyzing trends in software development.
- Gain insights into the most popular programming languages, platforms, and frameworks, as well as the challenges and opportunities facing developers today.

## Introduction

Stack Overflow, the go-to platform for developers, conducted a global survey to capture insights into the developer community. The survey includes questions related to professional experience, coding activities, tools, technologies, and preferences.

In this lab, you will work with a **subset** of the original dataset to explore, analyze, and visualize various trends. The data consists of responses from developers with diverse professional backgrounds, educational levels, and geographic locations.

## Dataset Source

The dataset is part of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey and is licensed under the Open Database License (ODbL).

## Subset Information

This project uses a curated subset of the full dataset, containing several thousand responses.  
**Note:** The findings may not fully represent the global developer population.
